ConsoleGeneratorBundle
======================

Replaces a few of symfony's default generators

Updates to symfony's console commands probably make this bundle pointless.

The templates can be copied to directories as mentioned in

php app/console doctrine:generate:crud --help

consider deleting this bundle by the end of summer, 2015.
